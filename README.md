# Blender-Navigation-Using-LiDAR
This workspace describes, how using LiDAR, data collected from a plane, detects the various, faces edges, and depth features of any object in front of it. 
Based on the data collected for (X, Y, Z) we need to do pre_processing to find the accurate coordinate or Area to map.



After precisely calculating the grid points and mesh, we can move our any custom object on the planned trajectory.
